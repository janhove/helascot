Description: Datasets for the Heritage Language and School Language (HELASCOT) project.
    The datasets included contain the pupils' performance on reading and writing
    tasks in their school language and their heritage language at three points in time
    ('skills'), questionnaire-based background information about the pupils
    ('background'), text-based metrics about the texts they wrote ('text_metrics'),
    and ratings of lexical richness given to these texts ('ratings').
    Detailed information about this project is available from
    https://osf.io/6bywg/ (for text-based metrics and ratings of lexical richness)
    and from the edited volume 'Heritage and school language literacy development
    in migrant children: Interdependence or independence?' (eds. Raphael Berthele
    and Amelia Lambelet, Multilingual Matters).
